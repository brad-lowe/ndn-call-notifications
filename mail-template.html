            Please do not reply or forward the email distribution, because multiple replies on different topics under the same subject would be messy and unmanageable. To discuss an issue, post a note on the relevant Redmine issue (remember to write Markdown syntax and use the "Preview" button before submitting) or send an email (with a descriptive title) to the nfd-dev mailing list.
